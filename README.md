Live Update for restaurant wait times

************
Party.js
This uses displays updates from a twitter feed via sockets.
The application uses twitter but the same thing can be accomplished via mongodb and node alone.

Twitter can be leveraged to access a wider user base.

Maps.js and Writer.js are another application piece that uses google maps api I have not determined the primary use of these.
